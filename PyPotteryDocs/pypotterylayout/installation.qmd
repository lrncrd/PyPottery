## Requirements

### Standalone Executable (Windows)
- **Operating System**: Windows 10/11
- **Memory**: 2GB+ RAM recommended
- **Browser**: Any modern browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox)
- **No Python installation required!**

### Running from Source
- **Python 3.12** installed on your system
- **Operating System**: Windows/macOS/Linux
- **Memory**: 2GB+ RAM recommended for large image sets

## Quick Start: Windows Executable

The easiest way to use PyPotteryLayout on Windows is with the standalone executable - **no installation required**!

<div style="text-align: center; margin: 20px 0;">
  <img src="..\imgs\icon_app.png" style="max-width: 150px; height: auto;">
</div>

1. Download `PyPotteryLayout.exe` from the [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/lrncrd/PyPotteryLayout/releases)
2. Double-click to run
3. Your default browser will open automatically
4. Upload images, configure layout, and export
5. Close the browser when finished

::: {.callout-note}
## 📌 Note
The executable runs a local web server. All processing happens on your computer - no internet connection required after download.
:::

::: {.callout-tip}
## 💡 Output Files Location
Files are saved next to the `.exe`:

- `uploads/` - Temporary uploaded images
- `outputs/` - Generated layouts and exports
- `pypotterylayout.log` - Application logs (for debugging)
:::

## Automated Installation (From Source)

Automated installation is the quickest and easiest way to get PyPotteryLayout running from source. The provided scripts will:

- ✅ Create a Python virtual environment
- ✅ Automatically install all dependencies
- ✅ Start the application

### Windows

Double click on the `PyPotteryLayout_WIN.bat` file.

The script will automatically perform the following steps:

- Check for Python on the system
- Create the `.venv` virtual environment (if it doesn't exist)
- Activate the virtual environment
- Install/upgrade pip
- Install dependencies from `requirements.txt`
- Start the Flask server at `http://localhost:5005`

::: {.callout-tip}
## 💡 Tip
On first run, dependency installation may take a few minutes. Subsequent runs will be much faster!
:::

### Linux / macOS

1. Open the **Terminal** in the project directory
2. Make the script executable (first time only):

```bash
chmod +x PyPotteryLayout_UNIX.sh
```

3. Run the script:

```bash
./PyPotteryLayout_UNIX.sh
```

The script will automatically:

- Check for Python 3 on the system
- Create the `.venv` virtual environment (if it doesn't exist)
- Activate the virtual environment
- Install/upgrade pip
- Install dependencies from `requirements.txt`
- Start the Flask server at `http://127.0.0.1:5005`

::: {.callout-note}
## 📌 Note
To stop the server, press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal.
:::


## Manual Installation

If you prefer full control over the installation process, you can follow these manual steps:

### 1. Create a Virtual Environment

It is strongly recommended to use a virtual environment to isolate project dependencies:

::: {.panel-tabset}

#### Windows

```bash
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate
```

#### Linux / macOS

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

:::

### 2. Upgrade pip

Upgrade pip to the latest available version:

```bash
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

Install all required dependencies from the `requirements.txt` file:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

::: {.callout-warning}
## ⚠️ Warning
Make sure you are in the project's root directory where the `requirements.txt` file is located.
:::

### 4. Start the Application

Once installation is complete, start the application with:

```bash
python app.py
```

The application will be available at:

::: {.callout-important}
## 🌐 Application URL
**http://localhost:5005**
:::



## Installation Verification

To verify that everything was installed correctly:

1. The application should start without errors
2. You should see a confirmation message in the terminal
3. Opening your browser at `http://localhost:5005` should display the PyPotteryLayout interface


## Troubleshooting

### Python not found

If you receive an error indicating that Python is not installed:

- **Windows**: Download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and make sure to check "Add Python to PATH" during installation
- **Linux**: Install Python using your distribution's package manager (e.g., `sudo apt install python3`)
- **macOS**: Install Python via [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) with `brew install python3`

### Dependency installation errors

If dependency installation fails:

1. Make sure you have an active internet connection
2. Try upgrading pip: `python -m pip install --upgrade pip`
3. Install dependencies one at a time to identify which package is causing issues

### Port 5005 already in use

If port 5005 is already occupied by another application, you can:

1. Close the application using the port
2. Or modify the port in the `app.py` file


## Updating

To update PyPotteryLayout to the latest version:

1. Download the latest version of the code (or new `.exe` for Windows)
2. Activate the virtual environment (if running from source)
3. Update dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt --upgrade
```
