    "text": "version 2.0.0 \n\n\nInterface Overview\nThe PyPotteryInk interface is divided into four main tabs:\n\nHardware Check\nModel Diagnostic\nPreprocessing\nBatch Processing\n\nAdditionally, you can toggle Dark Mode using the button in the interface.\n\n\nHardware Check\nThis tab allows you to analyze your PC’s hardware to verify compatibility with PyPotteryInk.\n\n\nThe page displays Recommended Specifications, indicating the minimum requirements to use the program.\nClicking on 🔍 Check Hardware will display your machine’s specifications along with a performance score.\nHere is an example of a hardware check result on a MacBook Air M3:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n🟠 Recommendation Level: RECOMMENDED\n\n\n\n\n🖥️ Hardware Specifications\n\nGPU: Apple Metal Performance Shaders (MPS)\nCPU: arm (8 cores)\nRAM: 16.0 GB\nDisk speed: Read: 5931.6 MB/s | Write: 233.8 MB/s\n\n\n\n📊 Hardware Score: 78/100 (78.0%)\n\n\n💡 Recommendations\n\n✅ Apple Metal Performance Shaders (MPS) - Excellent acceleration for Apple Silicon\n✅ 16GB or more RAM - Ideal for large image batches\n⚠️ Processor with 4+ cores\n⚠️ Decent disk but could be improved with an NVMe SSD\n✅ macOS system - Good compatibility\n💡 If using a laptop, ensure it’s well ventilated and connected to power\n💡 Consider using a cooling pad for laptops to avoid thermal throttling\n\n\n\n✅ Conclusion\nYour hardware is adequate for using PyPotteryInk, but you may encounter some limitations with very large images.\n💡 If you’re using a laptop, ensure it’s well ventilated and connected to power during processing\n\n\n\n\n\nModel Diagnostic\nThis tab allows you to test the model on a single image to verify its operation and determine the best parameters for batch processing.\n\n\nThe available elements are:\n\nSelect Model: Allows you to select the model to use (see the Model Zoo section for details). The model will be automatically downloaded during processing.\nPatch Size: Determines the size of the “chunks” the image is divided into for processing. Refer to the dedicated documentation section.\nUpload Images: This window allows you to upload images. You can use drag-and-drop or a dialog window. Once uploaded, images are displayed as thumbnails.\nOverlap: Determines the number of pixels where patches overlap. Refer to the dedicated documentation section.\nContrast Test Values: The model will generate an enhancement using the indicated values. To add a contrast value for evaluation, separate it with a comma.\n\nClicking on 🚀 Run Diagnostic will start the process, and a progress bar will indicate advancement. At the end of the process, a gallery will allow you to view the results.\n\n\nPreprocessing\nThis tab allows you to process images by adjusting statistics (contrast, etc.) to fit within a range known by the model.\n\n\nThere are two options:\n\nStep 1: Calculate Statistics\nYou can calculate statistics from a set of images. Uploading is done in the same way as the previous tab. The Save Statistics As text box allows you to decide the path and name of the .npy file. Click 📊 Calculate Statistics to perform the calculation.\n\n\nStep 2: Apply Preprocessing\nThis step allows you to apply the statistics. Images are uploaded in the same way. A checkbox allows you to use the statistics directly from Step 1. Alternatively, you can use an existing .npy file.\nPyPotteryInk provides two default .npy files:\n\nMontale_stats.npy (Metric measures of the dataset used to train the 6h-MCG model)\nCimino_stats.npy (Metric measures of the dataset used to train the 6h-MC model)\n\nIn short, these metrics can be used to make your images resemble those used to train the model.\nThe Output Directory text box allows you to indicate where the modified images will be saved. Click ✨ Apply Preprocessing to start. A progress bar will indicate the status.\n\n\n\nBatch Processing\nThis tab represents the core of the program where you can process a series of images.\n\n\nParameters like Select Model, Upload Images, Patch Size, and Overlap are the same as in the Preprocessing tab.\nNew parameters include:\n\nOutput Directory: Allows you to indicate where to save the results.\nContrast Scale: Allows you to indicate the contrast value to apply to the batch.\nScale Factor: Allows you to temporarily apply upsampling or downsampling to the images. After processing, images will be saved in their original dimensions, so there is no need to rescale them manually.\nUse FP16: Allows you to apply the model using half-precision (requires CUDA).\n\nClicking on 🚀 Start Processing will start the operation. A double progress bar will indicate the processing of patches and drawings. The results will be shown in a gallery.",

The function will randomly select images from this folder for analysis.\nmodel_path: Points to your trained model file. This model contains the learned patterns for converting pencil drawings to inked versions.\nnum_sample_images: Controls how many images to analyse. For a small collection, 1-2 images might suffice, but for larger collections with varying drawing styles, you might want to test more.\ncontrast_values: These values help us understand how different contrast levels affect the model’s output. Think of this like adjusting the pressure of your pen when inking - too light (low contrast) might lose details, while too heavy (high contrast) might create unwanted artefacts.\n\nThe diagnostic process creates a structured output that helps us understand how our images will be processed:\ndiagnostic/\n├── contrast_analysis_{progressive_number}.png  # Shows how contrast affects results\n├── patches_{progressive_number}.png            # Shows how images will be divided\n└── summary_{progressive_number}.txt            # Contains detailed analysis\nLet’s examine the patch division output (Figure 1):\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: This visualization shows how your image will be processed in smaller chunks.\n\n\n\nThe patch division is crucial because it shows us how the model will break down larger images into manageable pieces. The overlap between patches helps prevent visible seams in the final output.\nNext, let’s look at the contrast analysis (Figure 2):\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: This analysis shows how different contrast values affect the model’s output. Notice how extreme values can either lose detail (too low) or create artefacts (too high).\n\n\n\nThis visualization is particularly important because it helps us find the sweet spot for contrast enhancement. Looking at the results:\n\nA contrast value of 0.5 is too low, causing loss of fine details\nA contrast value of 3.0 is too high, introducing unwanted artefacts\nValues between 1.0 and 1.5 seem to produce the most balanced results",

If your scans are too light or too dark, consider adjusting them before processing (Section 3).\nMonitor the processing logs. If you see many failed conversions, it might indicate issues with your input images or parameters.\nReview the comparison images carefully. They can help you spot any systematic issues that might need addressing.\nUpscaling can help achieve a better result, especially when dealing with complex decorations.
