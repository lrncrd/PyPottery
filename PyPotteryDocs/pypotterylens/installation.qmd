## Requirements

Before installing PyPotteryLens, make sure you have:

- **Python 3.12** installed on your system

## Automated Installation

Automated installation is the quickest and easiest way to get PyPotteryLens running. The provided scripts will:

- ✅ Create a Python virtual environment
- ✅ Automatically install all dependencies
- ✅ Start the application

### Windows

Double click on the `PyPotteryLens_WIN.bat` file.

The script will automatically perform the following steps:

- Check for Python on the system
- Create the `.venv` virtual environment (if it doesn't exist)
- Activate the virtual environment
- Install/upgrade pip
- Install dependencies from `requirements.txt`
- Start the Flask server

::: {.callout-tip}
## 💡 Tip
On first run, dependency installation may take a few minutes. Subsequent runs will be much faster!
:::

### Linux / macOS

1. Open the **Terminal** in the project directory
2. Make the script executable (first time only):

```bash
chmod +x PyPotteryLens_UNIX.sh
```

3. Run the script:

```bash
./PyPotteryLens_UNIX.sh
```

The script will automatically:

- Check for Python 3 on the system
- Create the `.venv` virtual environment (if it doesn't exist)
- Activate the virtual environment
- Install/upgrade pip
- Install dependencies from `requirements.txt`
- Start the Flask server

::: {.callout-note}
## 📌 Note
To stop the server, press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal.
:::


## Manual Installation

If you prefer full control over the installation process, you can follow these manual steps:

### 1. Create a Virtual Environment

It is strongly recommended to use a virtual environment to isolate project dependencies:

::: {.panel-tabset}

#### Windows

```bash
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate
```

#### Linux / macOS

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

:::

### 2. Upgrade pip

Upgrade pip to the latest available version:

```bash
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

Install all required dependencies from the `requirements.txt` file:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

::: {.callout-warning}
## ⚠️ Warning
Make sure you are in the project's root directory where the `requirements.txt` file is located.
:::

### 4. Start the Application

Once installation is complete, start the application with:

```bash
python app.py
```

## Installation Verification

To verify that everything was installed correctly:

1. The application should start without errors
2. You should see a confirmation message in the terminal
3. Opening your browser at the indicated URL should display the PyPotteryLens interface

## Troubleshooting

### Python not found

If you receive an error indicating that Python is not installed:

- **Windows**: Download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and make sure to check "Add Python to PATH" during installation
- **Linux**: Install Python using your distribution's package manager (e.g., `sudo apt install python3`)
- **macOS**: Install Python via [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) with `brew install python3`

### Dependency installation errors

If dependency installation fails:

1. Make sure you have an active internet connection
2. Try upgrading pip: `python -m pip install --upgrade pip`
3. Install dependencies one at a time to identify which package is causing issues
