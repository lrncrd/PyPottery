<center> A Python library for the quantitative study of archaeological pottery. </center>

<hr>

`PyPottery` is a Python library specifically designed for the quantitative analysis and study of archaeological ceramic profiles. It offers a versatile suite of tools to facilitate:

- **Dataset creation**: A guidated workflow to construct and store profile and archaeological information datasets.
- **Morphological analysis**: Conduct analyses of profiles using several shape descriptors and other analysis tools like dimensionality reduction methods and clustering alghoritm.
- **Data visualization**: Generate interactive visualizations to simplify and enhance the interpretation of the results.

`PyPottery`'s primary objective is to provide archaeologists with a user-friendly and efficient Python tool for quantitative ceramic profile analysis. This library empowers researchers of all experience levels to:

- **Simplify complex workflows**: Streamline the analysis process and expedite research efforts.
- **Enhance research reproducibility**: Promote consistent and transparent research methodologies.
- **Intuitive and accessible**: The library prioritizes user-friendliness, ensuring a smooth learning curve and facilitating adoption even for researchers with limited Python experience.
- **Flexible and adaptable**: While offering user-friendly functionalities, `PyPottery` maintains adaptability for complex analyses, extending its utility beyond the scope of its core functionalities.

The project is a 'by-product' of an archaeology PhD project, and is **under continuous development** and open to external contributions. It aims to provide a comprehensive framework for the quantitative analysis of ceramic profiles, including more classical analytical techniques and deep learning methods that can both analyse the shape of profiles and facilitate the creation of datasets and corpus.

## Installation (**not already available!**)

`PyPottery` is available on PyPI and can be installed using pip:

```bash
