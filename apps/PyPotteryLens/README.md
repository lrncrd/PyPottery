## Project Structure

The application organizes your work into projects, each with this structure:

```
projects/
└── YourProject_20250104_123456/
    ├── project.json              # Project metadata
    ├── pdf_source/               # Original PDF files
    ├── images/                   # Extracted page images
    ├── masks/                    # Detection masks (PNG with segmentation)
    ├── cards/                    # Individual pottery instances
    │   ├── mask_info.csv         # Metadata spreadsheet
    │   └── mask_info_annots.csv  # Bounding box annotations
    ├── cards_modified/           # Oriented/classified instances
    │   └── classifications.csv   # Classification results
    └── exports/                  # Final exported data
```

## Usage Workflow

### 1. 📁 Project Management

Create and organize your archaeological datasets as individual projects. Each project maintains:

- Workflow status tracking (PDF processed, model applied, cards extracted, etc.)
- Custom project icons for easy identification
- Metadata including creation date, description, and processing statistics
- Isolated folders for all processing stages

**Best Practices**:

- Use descriptive project names (e.g., "Capena_2018_Vol_II", "Veio_Excavation_2024")
- Projects are automatically timestamped to avoid conflicts
- You can work on multiple projects simultaneously

### 2. 📄 PDF Document Processing

Upload PDF files containing pottery drawings. The processor extracts high-quality images from each page.

**Options**:

- **Split Scanned Pages**: Enable this when your PDF contains two-page spreads (common in scanned books). The system will split each page into left and right halves.

**File Naming**: Use simple formats without spaces or special characters:

- ✅ Good: `Cardarelli_2022.pdf`, `MonteCimino_2025.pdf`
- ❌ Avoid: `My Document (2024) v2.pdf`

**Output**: Images are saved to `{project}/images/` with systematic naming:

- Standard: `ProjectName_page_0.jpg`, `ProjectName_page_1.jpg`, ...
- Split mode: `ProjectName_page_0a.jpg`, `ProjectName_page_0b.jpg`, ...

### 3. 🤖 Apply Detection Model

Run the YOLO-based computer vision model to automatically detect pottery fragments.

**Model Parameters**:

- **Confidence Threshold** (0.1-1.0): Controls detection sensitivity
  - Higher (0.7-0.9): Fewer detections, higher precision, misses difficult cases
  - Lower (0.3-0.5): More detections, catches subtle instances, may include false positives
  - Recommended: Start at 0.5 and adjust based on your dataset

- **Kernel Size**: Affects mask edge smoothing during post-processing
  - Larger values create smoother, more rounded edges
  - Smaller values preserve fine details
  - Recommended: 2-5 for most cases

- **Iterations**: Number of morphological operation passes
  - More iterations strengthen the smoothing/gap-closing effect
  - Can help close small gaps in masks
  - Recommended: 5-15 iterations

**Advanced Options**:

- **Diagnostic Mode**: Process only the first 25 images for quick parameter testing

- **Image Exclusion**: Exclude specific images from processing (useful for title pages, indices, etc.)

**Output**: Creates segmentation masks in `{project}/masks/` where detected pottery appears as semi-transparent overlays.

### 4. ✏️ Review Annotations & Extract Instances

Manually review and refine the automatic detections using an interactive canvas editor.

**Tools Available**:

- **Brush (🖌️)**: Add to masks, adjustable size
- **Eraser (🧹)**: Remove parts of masks, adjustable size


**Workflow**:

1. Browse through detected images using the file explorer
2. Click on any image to open the editor
3. Use brush/eraser to refine mask boundaries
4. Changes auto-save when you navigate away
5. Click "Extract Masks" when review is complete

**Output**: Individual pottery instances are saved to `{project}/cards/` with naming:

- `ProjectName_page_0_mask_layer_0.png`
- `ProjectName_page_0_mask_layer_1.png`
- etc.

Two CSV files are generated:

- `mask_info.csv`: Empty spreadsheet ready for metadata
- `mask_info_annots.csv`: Bounding box coordinates for each instance

### 5. 📊 Tabular Information

Add archaeological metadata to each detected pottery instance.

**Features**:

- View original images with bounding boxes highlighting each instance
- Navigate between pages and select specific instances
- Add custom columns for any metadata fields (e.g., "Fabric", "Chronology", "Context")
- Auto-save: Every cell edit is immediately saved
- Multi-instance pages: Easily switch between fragments on the same page

**Data Management**:

- Data is stored in `mask_info.csv`
- Avoid commas in cell values (CSV format limitation)
- For bulk editing, you can export and edit in Excel/Google Sheets

**Workflow**:

1. Click "Add Column" to create new metadata fields
2. Navigate through images using Previous/Next buttons
3. Click cells to edit values
4. Use instance selector for pages with multiple pottery fragments
5. Mark pages as "Reviewed" to track progress

### 6. 🔄 Post Processing

Automatically orient and classify pottery instances using deep learning.

**Processing Options**:

- **Auto Vertical Flip**: Detects and corrects upside-down pottery (mouth facing down → mouth facing up)
- **Auto Horizontal Flip**: Standardizes profile orientation (all profiles face left)

**Classification**: The model automatically categorizes each instance:

- **ENT** (Entire/Complete): Substantially complete pottery profiles
- **FRAG** (Fragment): Partial or fragmentary profiles

**Manual Corrections**:

- **Flip Vertical/Horizontal**: Override automatic orientation if needed
- **Type Dropdown**: Change classification between ENT/FRAG

**Review Interface**:

- **Original vs. Processed**: Side-by-side comparison
- **Navigation**: Browse through all instances
- **Auto-save**: All changes immediately persisted

**Output**: 

- Processed images saved to `{project}/cards_modified/`
- Classifications stored in `classifications.csv`
- Merge with metadata to create `merged_annotations.csv`

### 7. 📦 Export Results

Generate final outputs with standardized naming.

**Export Options**:

- **Acronym**: Assign a short identifier (e.g., "CRD", "VEII") for systematic file naming: files will be named: `{acronym}_0.png`, `{acronym}_1.png`, etc.


**Output**: 

- Exported files saved to `{project}/exports/{acronym}/`
- Includes renamed images
- Metadata CSV with final classifications
